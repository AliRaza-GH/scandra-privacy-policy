  1.	Introduction
Welcome to Scandra. This Privacy Policy explains how Mibhsa Code collects, uses and discloses information when you use our mobile application, Scandra.
Your privacy is important to us. We are committed to protecting your data and being transparent about our practices. By using our Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
Scandra does not require user registration or a login account. We do not collect personally identifiable information like your name, email address, or phone number directly.
2.	Information We Collect and How We Use It
	To provide the features of Scandra, we need to process certain types of data. This data is processed to perform a specific function and is not stored on our servers.
•	Camera Data (CAMERA permission): We require access to your camera to enable features like the QR Code Scanner, Barcode Scanner and Document Scanner (Scan to PDF/JPG). The camera feed is processed in real-time on your device. Images are only saved to your device's gallery if you explicitly choose to do so.
•	Images and Files from Your Device (Read External Storage Permission): For features like Text Extraction, QR/Barcode scanning from a file and document scanning, you can choose to select an image or file from your device's gallery. The selected file is processed locally by the app to perform the requested function.
•	Audio Data (Record Audio Permission): We require access to your microphone for the Speech-to-Text feature. The audio is captured only when you activate this feature, converted to text, and is not stored after the conversion is complete.
•	Device Storage (Write External Storage Permission): This permission is required to save the output of features, such as scanned PDF/JPG files, to your device's local storage. You are in full control of these saved files.
3.	Third-Party Services and Data Sharing
We use third-party services to help us operate, improve, and advertise our Service. These services may collect data from your device. We do not share the content you process (images, audio) with these services, but they may collect technical and usage data as described below.
•	Google AdMob: We use AdMob to display advertisements in the app. AdMob may collect and use data such as your device's Advertising ID, IP address, and device information to provide personalized ads. You can learn more about how Google handles data in its advertising products here:
	Google's Privacy & Terms: https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads
•	Google Analytics for Firebase: We use this service to understand how users interact with our app (e.g., which features are most popular). It collects anonymous usage data and device information, such as device model, OS version, and session duration. This helps us improve the app's performance and user experience.
•	Firebase Crashlytics: We use this service to identify and analyze app crashes and errors. If the app crashes, Crashlytics may collect information about your device and the state of the app at the time of the crash. This data is crucial for us to fix bugs and improve stability.
	Firebase Privacy Policy: https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy
•	Google ML Kit: We use Google's ML Kit for features like document scanning, text recognition, and translation. Depending on the feature, data may be processed on-device or sent to Google's servers for processing (e.g., for cloud-based translation). Google does not use this data for any purpose other than providing the ML Kit feature.
	Google APIs Terms of Service: https://developers.google.com/terms
4. 	Permissions Justification
Here is a summary of the permissions Scandra requests and why they are necessary:
•	Internet & Access Network State: Required to display advertisements (AdMob), perform cloud-based translations (ML Kit), and send anonymous analytics and crash reports (Firebase).
•	Camera: Essential for real-time scanning of QR codes, barcodes, and documents.
•	Record Audio: Essential for the Speech-to-Text feature to capture your voice.
•	Read/ Write External Storage (for Android 12 and below): Required to access images/files from storage and to save your generated documents (PDFs/JPGs) to your device.
•	Vibrate: Used to provide haptic feedback to confirm a successful scan.
5.	Data Security
We take reasonable measures to protect the information processed by our app. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.
6.	Children's Privacy
	Our Service is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected such information, we will take steps to remove it.
7.	Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
